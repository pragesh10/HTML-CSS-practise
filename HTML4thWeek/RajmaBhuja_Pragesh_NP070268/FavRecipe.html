    <h2 >Recipie Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Rajma</strong> aka <strong>Kidney Beans</strong> are one of the most liked dish throughout the indian subcontinent. It is a comfort food for many just like it is to me. 
    It is cooked in a thick, flavorful tomato-onion gravy and served with steamed rice(mostly). Rajma is cooked in a pressure cooker and then transferred
    to a pan where its gravy is prepared to give it a creamy, tasty flavour burst.</p>

    <h2>Special Note</h2>
    <p>
        <em>
            My very first memory of eating rajma is when i went to my father's maternal uncle house and when i took the first bite of that rice and rajma, i fell in love instantly. I remember every time we went to his house, rajma used to be cooked and
    every time it tasted the same, the soft creamy flavour (My mouth is watering rn lol) made me fall in love even hard. I aspire to become a Fully Vegan, not only in food choices but also my lifestyle. And i believe, the coincidence of me loving rajma and other beans will 
    make my journey of veganism even effortless.
